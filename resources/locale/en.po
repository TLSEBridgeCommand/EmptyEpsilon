"The Ghosts, an abbreviation of \"ghosts in the machine\", are the result of "
"complex artificial intelligence experiments. While no known race has "
"intentionally created such intelligences, some AIs have come about by "
"accident. None of the factions claim to have had anything to do with such "
"experiments, in part out of fear that it would give the others too much "
"insight into their research programs. This \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy "
"does little but aid the Ghosts' agenda.\n"
"\n"
"What little is known about the Ghosts dates back to a few decades ago, when "
"glitches started occurring in prototype ships and computer mainframes. Over "
"time, and especially when such prototypes were captured by other factions "
"and \"augmented\" with their technology, the glitches became more frequent. "
"At first, these were seen as the result of mistakes in the interfaces "
"combining the incompatible technologies. But once a supposedly \"dumb\" "
"computer asks its engineer if \"it is alive\" and whether it \"has a name\", "
"it's hard to call it a one-time fluke.\n"
"\n"
"The first of these occurrences were met with fear and rigorous data-purging "
"scripts. Despite these actions, such \"ghosts in the machine\" kept turning "
"with increasing frequency, eventually leading up to the Ghost Uprisings. The "
"first Ghost Uprising in 2225 was put down by the human navy, which had to "
"resort to employing mercenaries in order to field sufficient forces. This "
"initial uprising was quickly followed by three more, each larger then the "
"last. The fourth and final uprising on the industrial world of Topra III was "
"the Ghosts' first major victory."

"The Ktlitans are intelligent eight-legged creatures that resemble Earth's "

"fight among themselves. Their common, and only, goal is their species' "
"survival.\n"
"\n"
"While they live in a hierarchical structure that resembles a hive, the lower "
"castes continue their work and start new tasks on their own even when no "
"orders come from their superiors. However, when higher castes are present, "
"the lower Ktlitans follow their orders without question or hesitation.\n"
"\n"
"Not much is known about the detailed Ktlitan hierarchy since they refuse "
"most communication. This is because they were once driven from their "
"homeworld over a span of 200 years when another species they befriended "
"betrayed them, dominated them, and drained their world of resources. Forced "
"into exile, the Ktlitans have searched for a new homeworld ever since, and "
"out of paranoia typically attack other races on sight and without warning.\n"
"\n"
"It is known, however, that the strict Ktlitan hierarchy starts with their "
"Queen and extends all the way to the bottom of their workforce, whose "
"members are called \"drones\" by the humans. Their combat capabilities "
"should not be underestimated, because while most ships in their fleets are "
"individually weak, their hive-like coordination and numbers can quickly "
"overwhelm even hardened targets. Most of their ships are unshielded, which "
"makes EMPs largely ineffective against them. Ktlitans also have no qualms "
"about applying suicidal tactics to ensure the Queen's survival."
